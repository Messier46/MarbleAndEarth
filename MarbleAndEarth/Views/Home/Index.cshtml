        <h2>What We Make</h2>
        <p>Decorative pots, statues and custom orders. If it can be carved and filed or molded and fired we will make it.</p>
        <p>All earthenware we make can be made in three types of clay. Earthenware which is the most common and used since the beginning of pottery. Fire clay which has a high firing range, little impurities, and gives a spekled look when fired. Finally we have kaolin clay which is often used to make porcelain and comes out near-white to white when fired</p>
